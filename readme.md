# Submission Requirements

## 1. Initial Setup:

* Watch the lecture on the main/command branch, which covers REPL and the command pattern.

## 2. (Bonus) Implement a Menu Command:

* Create a menu command that displays available commands from the command dictionary at the application's start and when the user types "menu." This is a self-guided challenge to deepen your understanding of dynamic command integration.

## 3. Testing and Code Coverage:

* With the calculator commands integrated, update and expand your tests to achieve 100% test coverage, ensuring your program's functionality is fully verified.

## 4. Plugin Architecture:

* Learn to refactor your program to automatically load plugins, facilitating easy command additions without manual updates.

## 5. (Bonus Explor Multiprocessing Capabilities:

* Investigate adding multiprocessing features to enable commands/plugins to run on separate cores. This enhancement is a forward-looking feature that prepares your application for future scalability and performance improvements.
